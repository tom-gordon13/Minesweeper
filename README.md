<br>
<p>Originally debuted in 1990, <i>Minesweeper</i> may be the world's most popular time-wasting game. Come re-live the 90's with this rendition of the classic that was partially devised as a way to teach users the basics of mouse control following an era where most computers relied on text-based interaction</p>
<br>
<p>Left click to dig for a mine. Right click to place a flag. Some things never change, including the ever-present smiley face watching over all. And don't worry, for those <i>Minesweeper</i> experts out there who spent hours mindlessly clicking for mines back in the day, feel free to up the difficulty and prove your mettle.</p>

<summary> Gameplay Instructions</summary>

| The Basics |  |
|------------ | ------------|
| <h4 align="left">Left-click on a square to check if there is a mine underneath. If a number appears in that square, BEWARE! That is the number of mines underneath adjacent squares!</h4> | <img src='images/Minesweeper-1.png' width="1100"> |
| <h4 align="left">Right-click on a square if you believe there is a marker underneath. The tracker in the upper left tells you how many mines remain un-marked, assuming you haven't incorrectly placed a marker.</h4> | <img src='images/Minesweeper-2.png' width="1100"> |

<summary> How to Win... or Lose!</summary>

| How to Win |  |
|------------ | ------------|
| <h4 align="left">There are two ways to win - either correctly mark all of the squares with mines, or dig up all of the squares without! The smiley will look down upon you fondly if you win.</h4> | <img src='images/Minesweeper-3.png' width="1100"> |
| <h4 align="left">If you accidentally left-click on a mine - game over! The smiley will not be happy.</h4> | <img src='images/Minesweeper-4.png' width="1100"> |
